Understanding of the Case (index.html, style.css, script-step2.js)

This small project demonstrates the concept of event-driven programming in JavaScript using HTML, CSS, and JS files.
index.html:

It provides the basic structure of the web page. 
The page includes:
An input field where the user types text.
A “Submit” button that triggers an event.
A paragraph element (<p>) to display the output.
A placeholder for dynamically added buttons (#buttonContainer) and an “Add New Button” feature (for later steps).

It links to style.css for styling and script-step2.js for interactivity.

style.css:
Handles the visual design of the page (not shown here but typically used for layout, spacing, colors, and font styling).

script-step2.js:
Demonstrates event handling in JavaScript.

It adds an event listener to the “Submit” button (#submitBtn).

When clicked, it reads the text entered in the input field and displays it dynamically inside the paragraph element (#output).
Core Concept:
This example shows how user actions (events) such as clicking a button can trigger JavaScript functions to make a web page interactive — a key principle in event-driven programming.
